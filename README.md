# Cpccbb

**Cpccbb** *aka* CopyPasteCharacter Clone, But Better is exactly what it says on a tin â€” a clone of [Copy Paste Character](https://www.copypastecharacter.com/), but better, at least better in the sense that it works in post-Flash era.

I used to love the original CPC, it was my go-to place for copying characters that I needed sometimes, but not often enough to remember the codes or to bother creating my own copy sheet of it. Now that CPC has been abandoned for some time already, I created **Cpccbb**.
